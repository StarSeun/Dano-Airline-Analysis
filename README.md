## Introduction: 

The airline industry is highly competitive, and customer satisfaction is a key factor that determines the success of an airline. The airline's leadership team has identified a recent dip in passenger satisfaction ratings which prompted them (the leadership team) to seek recommendations for a data-driven strategy to increase overall satisfaction rates.

The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset of airline passenger satisfaction scores to identify key factors that contributed to the low satisfaction rates and focus on getting back on track. The dataset used for this analysis contains feedback from over 120,100 airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel, as well as their evaluation of different factors such as cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.

The project involved analyzing the dataset to identify key factors that were contributing to the recent dip in satisfaction rates. This analysis included calculating several key performance indicators such as total passengers, average arrival and departure delays, and satisfaction and dissatisfaction rates.

## Key Metrics:

1. What is the Average Flight Distance?
2. What is the Average Departure Delay?
3. What is the Satisfaction/Dissatisfaction rates per travel group?

## Skills:
The following Power BI features were incorporated-

### Recommendations:
- Improve Economy and Economy Plus Experience: 
Invest in better seating comfort and onboard services.o o Address specific dissatisfaction drivers (e.g., in-flight entertainment, food quality).
- Reduce Delays:
Though moderate, reducing average arrival and departure delays may improve customer perception, especially for short-haul flights.
- Reevaluate Economy plus offering:
Despite being positioned above Economy, it yields the lowest satisfaction. Consider rebranding or restructuring benefits to align with customer expectations.
- Customer Feedback Loop:
Continuously collect qualitative feedback from dissatisfied customers to refine services and address specific concerns.

## Conclusion:
This analysis highlights critical pain points within Dano Airlinesâ€™ service, especially in Economy and Economy Plus classes. Immediate strategic interventions focusing on comfort, service enhancements, and better handling of special passenger groups can substantially improve satisfaction and secure long-term loyalty.
